# ToyBomb
 great for young sappers

Support pesetting of time by 3 keys on the shield, shows remaining time, beeps, blinks, all wires have special effects when being disconnected, cutting only 1 of 4 wires will stop the countdown ... 
Good luck!

Hardware: 
- Arduino UNO
- arduino-multi-function-shield (see photo)
- 4x2 wires (must connect 4 pins of the shield to GND for normal operation, see photo)

Uses this lib for the arduino-multi-function-shield:
