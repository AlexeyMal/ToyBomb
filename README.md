Supports setting of time using 3 keys on the shield, shows remaining time, beeps, blinks, all colored wires have special effects when being cut (disconnected), cutting only 1 of 4 wires will stop the countdown ... Guess what happens if you cut the wrong wire ;-)
Good luck!

Hardware: 
- Arduino UNO
- arduino-multi-function-shield (see photo)
- 4x2 wires (must connect 4 pins of the shield to GND for normal operation, see photo)

Uses this lib for the arduino-multi-function-shield:
